    Hi, I'm Chappy ðŸ‘‹
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a self-driven full stack developer eager to try new things and continue
    to expand on my areas of knowledge. I am currently studying Computer Science
    at the University of Washington and pursuing a position as an intern at an
    exciting, driven company for this upcoming summer.
    <br/><br/>
    Since the beginning of high school I've had the priviledge of working for a
    variety of companies, including
    [Xevo](https://www.xevo.com), 
    [Suplari](https://www.suplari.com), 
    [Lime](https://www.li.me)
    among many others. While working at each of these companies, I have gained
    insights into how startups scale and function and how effective leaders are
    forged from positive, electric work environments.  
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond programming and improving people's lives by solving real-world problems,
    I enjoy challenging myself physically via weightlifting, organized
    endurance events, and hiking. I also enjoy spending time with my family and 
    friends whenever I find the time.
    <br/><br/>
