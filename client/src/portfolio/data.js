    Hi, I'm Chappy ðŸ‘‹
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a self-driven full stack developer eager to try new things and continue
    to expand on my areas of knowledge. I am currently studying Computer Science
    at the University of Washington and pursuing a position as an intern at an
    exciting, driven company for this upcoming summer.
    <br/><br/>
    Since the beginning of high school I've had the privilege of working for a
    variety of companies, including
    [Electronic Arts](https://www.ea.com),
    [Lime](https://www.li.me),
    [Xevo](https://www.xevo.com),
    [Respawn Entertainment](https://www.respawn.com),
    [Suplari](https://www.suplari.com),
    among others. While working at each of these companies, I have gained valuable
    insights into how startups scale and function and how effective leaders and
    cutting-edge products are forged from positive, electric work environments.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond developing products that solving real-world problems and improve
    people's lives, I enjoy challenging myself physically via weightlifting,
    organized endurance events, and hiking. I also enjoy spending time with my
    family and friends whenever I can find the time.
    <br/><br/>
    Below is a list of some of my recent personal projects. I have published two
    of these projects,
    [Homework App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1097438761)
    and
    [Weightlifting App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1266077653),
    to the iOS App Store which have a combined 350k+ installs. Homework App
    was acquired earlier this year by a private investor with which I negotiated
    the terms with personally.
